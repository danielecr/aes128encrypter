# aes128encrypter

Symmetric key encrypter/decrypter that make javascript and php agree on convensions, I wrote this with zmq message passing in mind, but it is for every place where javascript and php has to work together in a clean way.

Javascript is meant as nodejs, but I think it is possible to make it works with requirejs too, so in a browser.

Maybe it was clean to most, but I hope this interface is simpler and coherent between the two language/library.
